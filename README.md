## About UpStats

There are many great Opensource, Hosted Solutions for Status Page, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so we created this enhanced one. I want to create a Status Page so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need. I think this is the One.

Here's why:
* Managing your site's right from your Mobile is now easier with Mobile First Dashboard.
* You don't need to do the task, you can appoint others to do your Tasks.
* Let your user to know about your System Status directly via Email.
* Don't let your Telegram Bots simply Down

Since your needs maybe different.So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding UpStats!
